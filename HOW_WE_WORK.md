# How We Work

## Vendor pull requests

InspiringApps will work on their own fork of the repository. They will file a single pull request at the end of each sprint that includes all work completed in that sprint, as presented at the sprint review. It should be filed within one working day of the end of the sprint, e.g. if the sprint ends on a Thursday, it should be filed by the end of the day on Friday. That pull request will be titled for the sprint (e.g., `Sprint 15`), and the description will summarize the work of the sprint. That will lead with the sprint goal, and then list each completed user story. Each completed user story will include the title, will link back to the story in the backlog, and should include an illustrative screenshot (where applicable).

The Council of State Governments will review that pull request per the [code review process](CODE_REVIEW.md), to ensure that the work is compliance with the contract, and that the code adheres to best practices. CSG will make every effort to complete that code review within two working days of receiving it from InspiringApps, making that work the highest priority of the technical lead. Any requested changes etc. from CSG will be made in the spirit of collaboration and open discussion between CSG and IA, understanding that we are all learning together. When all issues raised in the code review have been addressed to CSGâ€™s satisfaction, the pull request will be merged.
